Her name was Scarlet,
and she was a calico tabby,
marked with many colors,
as one divided against herself, yet whole in purpose.

And the people looked upon her and said,
“We do not want her.”
Others said, “She is troublesome.”
And so they cast her out, thinking themselves delivered.

But they were not delivered.

For demons are not discarded.
They are redirected.

And I, being unguarded in spirit,
beheld her image and did not turn away.

Thus I brought her into my dwelling.

And when she crossed the threshold,
the air was altered.
The silence fled.
The peace withdrew itself.

Her name was Scarlet, but it did not endure,
for names are weak things,
and demons accept them only briefly.

She walked the house as one who measures territory,
and her eyes judged what was not yet hers.

She slept, and the house learned fear.
She woke, and the house learned suffering.

And it was known:
she had not come to be loved,
nor to be saved,
nor to be corrected.

She had come because she was sent.

And those who did not want her
had done wisely,
though they knew it not.
