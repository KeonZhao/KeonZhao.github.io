She was unleashed.” tags: [omen, cat, demon] categories: [news] —</p> <p>Her name was Scarlet, and she was a calico tabby, marked with many colors, as one divided against herself, yet whole in purpose.</p> <p>And the people looked upon her and said, “We do not want her.” Others said, “She is troublesome.” And so they cast her out, thinking themselves delivered.</p> <p>But they were not delivered.</p> <p>For demons are not discarded. They are redirected.</p> <p>And I, being unguarded in spirit, beheld her image and did not turn away.</p> <p>Thus I brought her into my dwelling.</p> <p>And when she crossed the threshold, the air was altered. The silence fled. The peace withdrew itself.</p> <p>Her name was Scarlet, but it did not endure, for names are weak things, and demons accept them only briefly.</p> <p>She walked the house as one who measures territory, and her eyes judged what was not yet hers.</p> <p>She slept, and the house learned fear. She woke, and the house learned suffering.</p> <p>And it was known: she had not come to be loved, nor to be saved, nor to be corrected.</p> <p>She had come because she was sent.</p> <p>And those who did not want her had done wisely, though they knew it not.</p> </body></html>
